**Tank Defender** is first attempt of my whole game development.
Tank Defender is a 3D Top Down multi-directional shooter video game
for PC. The main character is a
Tank in the playfield protecting its base.
Your mission is simple but critical: protect your base from relentless enemy incursions. 
As a skilled tank commander, you must use your wits, firepower, and tactical prowess to fend off waves of enemy tanks and various obstacles,
ensuring your base remains unscathed. Can you rise to the challenge and become the ultimate Tank Defender?

**GAMEPLAY**

The player controls a tank and shoots to destroy enemy tanks around the playfield. The enemy tanks randomly enter from the top, top left and top right of the screen and attempt to destroy the player's base (will be represented on the screen with some symbol),as well as the player's tank itself. 
Players can score while destroying the enemy's tank but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses its only available life. Note that the player can destroy the base as well, so the player can still lose when the base is destroyed by the player itself.
Currently there is only one map available.
The game becomes more challenging as time goes. Enemy tanks may act as decoys to lure players away from their base so that another tank of the enemy can destroy it.
